## Original Readme
Hacked together on-device App Store client, view it more-so as a PoC than as a final tool.

Publicizing because it could be useful for some people, however please use TrollStore MuffinStore over this if you can. This is not meant to be a final product, but it can be helpful for some people.

The UI is a bit scuffed, there's no progress bar during downgrading so just wait on the screen until you get a popup that requests installation ( the time this takes depends on how big the app is, so please wait. ), and then after you press install wait like ~5 more seconds and then you can return to SpringBoard to see the app downgrade being finalized.

I am not responsible for any issues caused by the usage of this tool, it's experimental and I will not be held accountable if anything happens. Use at your own risk. Although nothing should happen, just putting this here just in case.

The app you want to downgrade will need to be uninstalled, however, you can preserve app data by offloading the app first, and then downgrading it.

You should request a 2fa code BEFORE logging in, via the Settings app, however, if the settings app doesn't show the option ( iOS 18+ ), you can leave the code field empty, and then you should get a popup, accept it, and copy the code from there. If it doesn't log you in fully close and re-open the app and try again.
